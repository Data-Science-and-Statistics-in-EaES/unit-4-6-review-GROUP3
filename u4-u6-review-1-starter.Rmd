## Exercises

# Part I - Data Types and Classes

## Exercise 1 - Create some vectors

```{r month-name-vector}
month_name <- c("January", 
                "February",
                "March",
                "April",
                "May",
                "June",
                "July",
                "August",
                "September",
                "October",
                "November",
                "December")
```

n_days <- c(31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31)
```

Add your code here.

## Exercise 2 - Combine into a data frame

```{r merge-two-vectors, eval = F}
___ <- tibble::tibble(
  "month_name" = month_name,
  "___" = ___
)
```

#### Member 1

```{r merge-two-vectors-oa, eval = T}
merged_vectors <- tibble::tibble(
  "month_name" = month_name,
  "spongebob_characters" = spongebob_characters
)
```

#### Member 2

```{r merge-monthly-season, eval = F}
month_season <- tibble::tibble(
  "month_name" = month_name,
  "season" = season
)
```

#### Member 3

```{r merge-month-spooky}
month_spooky <- tibble::tibble(
  "month_name" = month_name,
  "spooky_season" = spooky_season
)
```

#### Member 4

```{r merge-group4, eval = T}
number_days <- tibble::tibble(
  "month_name" = month_name,
  "day_numbers" = n_days
)
```

#### Member 5

Add your code here.

## Exercise 3 - Try plotting with `month_name` on the x axis, then recode factors

#### Member 1

Add your code here.
```{r month-days-part-3}
number_days <- tibble::tibble(
  "month_name" = month_name,
  "day_numbers" = n_days
)
```

```{r}
ggplot(number_days, aes(x = month_name, y = day_numbers)) +
  geom_point()
```
